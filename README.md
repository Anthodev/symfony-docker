# Symfony Docker Supercharged

This repo is a fork from the [Symfony Docker](https://www.github.com/dunglas/docker-symfony) repo from [dunglas](https://www.github.com/dunglas/) with added improvements:
- Added `make` and `bash` into the php container.
- Added a `Makefile` file to run most of the usual Docker and Symfony commands with more ease
- Build the docker containers with the user and group id of the user running the command (preventing permission issues)
- Modified the `ci.yml` file in the `.github` folder to get quicker ci runs (while checking more thing in your project)
- Trigger the CI on pull requests by default
- Modified the `docker-compose.yml` file to set a name for the php container (for easier use of the `make` commands)

Below the original `README` of the project.

---

A [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)-based installer and runtime for the [Symfony](https://symfony.com) web framework,
with [FrankenPHP](https://frankenphp.dev) and [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) inside!

![CI](https://github.com/anthodev/symfony-docker/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

## Getting Started

1. If not already done, [install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v2.10+)
2. Run `docker compose build --no-cache` to build fresh images
3. Run `docker compose up --pull always -d --wait` to start the project
4. Open `https://localhost` in your favorite web browser and [accept the auto-generated TLS certificate](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15076602/1352334)
5. Run `docker compose down --remove-orphans` to stop the Docker containers.

## Features

* Production, development and CI ready
* Just 1 service by default
* Blazing-fast performance thanks to [the worker mode of FrankenPHP](https://github.com/dunglas/frankenphp/blob/main/docs/worker.md) (automatically enabled in prod mode)
* [Installation of extra Docker Compose services](docs/extra-services.md) with Symfony Flex
* Automatic HTTPS (in dev and prod)
* HTTP/3 and [Early Hints](https://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-6-3-early-hints) support
* Real-time messaging thanks to a built-in [Mercure hub](https://symfony.com/doc/current/mercure.html)
* [Vulcain](https://vulcain.rocks) support

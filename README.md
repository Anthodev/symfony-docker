# Symfony Docker Supercharged

This repo is a fork from the [Symfony Docker](https://www.github.com/dunglas/docker-symfony) repo from [dunglas](https://www.github.com/dunglas/) with added improvements:
- Added `make` and `bash` into the php container.
- Added a `Makefile` file to run most of the usual Docker and Symfony commands with more ease
- Build the docker containers with the user and group id of the user running the command (preventing permission issues)
- Modified the `ci.yml` file in the `.github` folder to get quicker ci runs (while checking more thing in your project)
- Trigger the CI on pull requests by default
- Modified the `docker-compose.yml` file to set a name for the php container (for easier use of the `make` commands)

Below the original `README` of the project.

---

A [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)-based installer and runtime for the [Symfony](https://symfony.com) web framework, with full [HTTP/2](https://symfony.com/doc/current/weblink.html), HTTP/3 and HTTPS support.

4. Open `https://localhost` in your favorite web browser and [accept the auto-generated TLS certificate](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15076602/1352334)
5. Run `docker compose down --remove-orphans` to stop the Docker containers.

## Features
